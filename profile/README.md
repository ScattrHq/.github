## Why Cross-Post your articles on different platforms?

### 1. Reach a larger audience 👥

Every platform has its own audience, by sharing an article/blog on multiple platforms, it can reach to a larger number of people who may not have otherwise come across it. This can lead to increased traffic to the original source and potential new readers for future content.

### 2. Improved SEO of your blog 🔼

When an article or blog is cross-posted on multiple platforms, it increases the number of backlinks to the original blog post. Backlinks are an important factor in determining a search engine ranking. 

### 3. Get more engagements & feedback for your product/service 💡

Cross-posting increases exposure and engagement, it'll help in building a community around a blog/website. It also provides more opportunities for readers to interact with content and each other through comments and social media.
